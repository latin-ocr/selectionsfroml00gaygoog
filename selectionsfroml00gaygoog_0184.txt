HANNIB AL.

ab Gallia sejungunt, quas nemo umquam cum exercitu
ante eum, praeter Herculem Grajum, transierat, quo
facto is hodie saltus Grajus appellatur: Alpicos, conan-
tes prohibere transitu, concidit, loca patefecit, itinera
muniit, effecit, ut ea elephantus ornatus ire posset, qua

antea unus homo 1ne1n1is vix poterat repere.

Hac co-

pias traduxit, in Italiamque pervenit.
IV. Conflixerat apud Rhodanum cum P. Cornelio

Scipione consule eumque pepulerat.

nibal chose is uncertain—some
say that of Mont Genevrc ; Momm·
sen and many othei-S, that of the
Little St. Bernard.

2. Herculem Grajum] Hercu-
les is here so called in distinction
from the Cretan, Phoenician‚ and
Celtic Herculea The whole story
ie, of course, a myth.

3. Grajus] ‘ Graian3’ the term
is of native origin.

Alpicos] These were the wild
and hardy mountaincerS.

5. ornatus] ‘With its equip-
ments?

elephantus, etc.] Observe in this
and the following clause the an-
titheses.

8. Rhodanum] This river rises
ln the AlpS, and, flowing through
Lake Geneva, enters Franco
through the Jura MountainS‚ and
empties into the Gulf of LyonS,
in the Mediterranean. As the
successive peoples of the Aryan
racc migrated to the west, they
gave each its own name, signify-
ing “ water ’⁹ or “river,” to the
stt-eumz. Not knowing that the

Cum hoc eodem

name which, the stream hore on
their arrival at it already meant
‘⁴ water ’⁹ or “river‚” the new
tribe, in many caseS‚ added its
own word to the name already
given. Thus the roots νΙιε, dan,
is, ter, —all of which mean “ wa-
ter‚'’—appear once, and some-

· times two or three εἴωθε, in the

names of very many of the rivers
of Europe. For instance, we have
Rho-dan-uS, Rhe-n-us‚ E-r(h)i- ’
dan-uS‚ Isffter, Dan-uv·ius‚ Tyr-as,
Damas-ter (Du-ies·ter).

9. Scipibne] He was the father
of Scipio Africanus, and fell in
Spain, in the year B. C. 211. For
a Roman who claimed to belong
to an ancient family, three names
were thought indispensable —a
praenomen (Publius), a nomen
(Cornelius), and a coynomen (Sci-
pio). The proenomen distinguished
the individual‚ and is generally
represented by a letter; the nomen
marked the gens or clan3 and the
coynomen, generally derived from
mental or bodily peculiarities. or
from remarkable experienceS, des-
ignatcd the family. A very dis-
tinguished person might have an
aqnomen, as Africanus, Asiaticus,
etc„ given him to commemorate
