8 PHAEDRI FABULAE.

Arcemtyrannus occupat Pisistratus.

Quum tristem servitutem flerent Attici,
(Non quia crudelis ille, sed quoniam grave
Omne insuetis onus) et coepissent queri,
AEsopus talem tum fabellam rettulit.

Ranae vagantes liberis paludibus

Clamore magno regem petiere a Jove,
Qui dissolutos mores vi compesceret.
Pater deorum risit atque illis dedit

partes implies a separation from
a whole3 hence factionum partes,
‘ divisions into partieS,’ or ⁴ differ·
ent political parties!

5. Arcem] ‘ The Acropolis.’ In
ancient times, an eminence was
selected at the first settlement of
a town, as being the place most
easily defended. The same cus·
tom of occupying the hill—tops
against the attacks of the Indians
obtained in the early settlement of
New England.—tyrannus] ‘As
ruler.' The word tyrannus did
not at first imply the odium which
we attach to tyrant, but simply
meant an absolute ruler of a state
previously free. vid. Nep. Milt„
8. Compare the history of our
words knave and villain, meaning
originally ‘ boy ’ and ‘ peasant.’ —
Pisistratus] The son of Hippo-
crateS. He became despot‘B. C.
560, and died B. C. 527. He
gained possession of the Acropo-
lis by means of a body-guard,
which had been assigned to him
for his defence against assassina-
tion from political opponents.

6. Attici] i. e., Athenienses.

7. Non quia erudelis — sed quo·
niam] In both of these clauses
erat is to be supplied. With the
first, as containing a reason re-

jected as invalid, esset would be
required in prose. By poetical
license, however, the indicative
can be used in both.—yrave]
Predicate adjective. H. 438, 2.

8. Omne—onus] ‘Every’ (how- '

ever slight). — imuetis] ‘ To those
unaccustomed to bear burdens:
To be scanned in four syllables.
For the sake of the metro υ is
sometimes regarded as a vowel:
silvae for silvae, soluit for solvit
(Diaeresis) ς and u as a consonant:
tenvia for tenuia, milvus for
miluus (Synaeresis). -- coepissent]
H. 518, II.

9. rettulit] For retulit ; see
repperit. Prol. v. 1.

10. liberis] ‘ Which were sub·
ject to no ruler.’ The realm of
the frogs is compared with the
republic of AthenS.— paludibus]
Ablative of place. H. 422, 1.

11. a Jove] The usualv con·
struction with verbs of asking is
two accusatives3 but peto takes
ace„ and abl. with a. H. 374, 3, 4).

12. vi] ‘By his authority.’—
compesceret] subjunctive, aster
qui in the sense of ut ille. H.
13. Pater deorum] Jupiter. —

patient in their liberty.
