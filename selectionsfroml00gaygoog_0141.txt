CORNELIUS NEPOS.

jure· gentium facere possent, deosque publicos suosque
patrios ac penateS, quo facilius ab hoste possent defen-
dere, muris sepsisse ; neque in eo, quod inutile esset Grae-
ciae, fecisse. Nam illorum urbem ut propugnaculum op-
5 positum esse barbaris, *apud quam jam bis classes regias
fecisse naufragium. ‘Lacedaemonios autem nflale et in-
juste facere, qui id potius intuerentur, quod ipsorum
dominationi, quam quod universae Graeciae utile esset.

Quare, si suos legatos recipere vellent, quos Athenas
10 miserant, se remitterent3 aliter illos numquam in patri·

am essent recepturi.

VIII. Tamen non effugit civium suorum invidiam.

Namque ob eundem timorem, quo damnatus erat Milz
tiades‚ testularum suffragiis e civitate ejectus, Argos

15 habitatum concessit. Hic quum propter multas ejus
virtutes magna cum dignitate viveret, Lacedaemonii
legatos Athenas miserunt, qui eum absentem accusa-

the admission of Themistecles.

1. deos] The dei publici were
the -national godS, worshipped
alike by all the Greeks; the dei
patrii were the gods of Athens
or Attica3 the penates, those of
the family or household.

4. oppositum] Following the
predicate noun, agrees with it
rather than with urbem.

6. fecisse naufraqium] Refer-
ring to the battles of Marathon
and Salamis.

7. intuerentur] subjunctive of
cause or reason. H. 517.

8. universae] ‘ As a whole.’

10. miserant] Cf. Miltiades,
p. 110, line 7, transportaverat.

ll. essent recepturi] Would
regularly have been recepturos
esse. Cf. PhaedruS, 9, 6, where a
similar construction occurs.

VIII. Banishment of The..
mistocles. Β. O. 471.

13. quo] Ablative of cause. H.

14. testularum suffrayiis] Os-
tracism is here meant. By this
means the Athenian democracy
banished, generally for ten yearS,
any one who was suspected of
ambitious designa or whose pre-
eminence was regarded as danger-
ous to the state. This was effected
by 6000 votes, which were record-
ed on pieces of tile. But the sen-1
tence involved no loss of honor or
of property.

Aryos] Is probably accusative
plural, as the neuter form is used

mostly by poets and geographers.

15. ejus] Irregular, as a result

of the author’s negligence, for
euos.
