‘vi PREFACE.

at the bottom' of the page, the usual custom of placing ,

them 'at the close of the volume has been abandoned.
Experience has shown that, unless the classis espe-
cially examined upon the contents of the “NoteS,''
they are in most cases neglected, unless absolutely
necessary for ascertaining the meaning of the passage.
This being the case, the more immediately they are
placed before the eye of the student, the more readily
will their contents be mastered.

It has not been expected that all of the notes will
meet the approval of —every teacher. Each one will
direct his pupils to such as he prefers should receive
their attention. One may think that at this point of
the course too much attention has been given to the
subjunctive mood3 another may think that now is not
the time to draw the pupil's attention to the syno-
nymes. Burin the belief that much profit can be de—
rived from attention to them, a good deal of pains
has been taken< to insert those which are manifestly
within the, power of *discrimination of quite young
persons, In a great majority of caseS, the words
whose difference of meaning is pointed out occur in
the volume3 in many, in close proximity, and in no
case is a word given with which the pupil is sup·
posed to be unacquainted. So, too, an occasional
point of construction or translation may seem to a
teacher to be hypercritical. Ifff SO, he can direct his
scholare to disregard it.

In preparing the notes the editors have freely
availed themselves of all the materials within their
reach. The best and most recent German editions of
all three of the authors have been consulted.

In conclusion, the editors wish to acknowledge
their great indebtedness to Professor George M. Lane,
of Harvard University, for the valuable suggestions
kindly afforded by him in the progress of the work.
