CORNELIUS NEPOS.

cives possent sui talem eum futurum, qualem cognitum
judicarunt: accidit, ut Athenienses Chersonesum colonos

vellent mittere.

Cujus generis quum magnus numerus

esset, et multi ejus demigrationis peterent societatem,
ὅ ex his delecti Delphos deliberatum missi sunt, qui con-
sulerent Apollinem, quo potissimum duce uterentur.

Namque‚tum Thraces eas regiones tenebant, cum qui·
bus armis erat dimicandum.t‘- His consulentibus nomi-

natim Pythia praecepit, ut Miltiadem imperatorem sibi
10 sumerent: id si fecissent, incepta prospera sutura. Hoc

1. sui] Ejus would be more
natural, but the reflexive is used
with especial emphasis, as his own
follow-citizens could best judge
him.

futurum] Sc. esse, which Ne-‘
pos always omits with the future
infinitive active. H. 545, 3.

qualem — judicarunt] ⁸ As they
judged him on acquaintance!

2. accidit] The subject is ut vel·
lent, etc. H. 495, 2.

Chersonesum] The word signi-
flcs land-island, i. e., peninsula.
SeveralGreek names of maritime
countries ending in us are con-
strued like names of towns. > H.

3. Cm‘myeneris] ‘Of this class.'

5. Delphos] This was a small
but noted town in Phocis, on the
south-western slope of Mount
Parnassus, and was the seat of
the most celebrated oracle of an-
tiquity. .

deliberatum] ‘ To ask advice 3 ’
it denotes the purpose, but this
construction, though quite classi-
cal, is not very common. H.
569, 4.

qui —ApolanemJ Is explana-
tory, showing how the purpose
was to be effected. Apollo is con-

sulted as the god of prophecy, re-
vesling the will of Zeus in oracles
through the Pythia.

6. duce] ⁴ As leader‚' an apposi-
tive of condition or quality.

7. cum quibus] Nepos always
places cum before the relative;
the best authors usually append
it when not emphatic.

8. nominatim] ⁴ Expressly ; ' for
the responses were usually vagus
and ambiguous. For the deriva-
tion, see H. 334, 2.

9. Pythia] The Pythia, or
priestess of the Pythian Apollo,
was, in early times, a young gir13
afterwardS, no woman under fifty
years of age could be elected a
prophetess. Seated on a tripod,
over a chasm in the earth, whence
rose an intoxicating smoke‚ she
fell into a state of delirium, and
uttered the sounds which were
believed to be the revelatione of
the god. In the most flourishing
period of this oracle„ there were
three Pythias. The name is de·
rived from Pytho, the older name
of Delphi and its environs.

10. fecissent] The pluperfect
subjunctive for the future perfect
in direct discourse. H. 533, 4.

futtern] Depends on a verbum
