LIFE OF ‚ ζΠῚΞΤΙΝ.

 

ΤΗΒ age in which J ustin lived, and even his entire
name, are matters of doubt. In most manuscripts,
merely the name J ustinus is given3 in one he is called
J ustinus Frontinus, and in another M. J unianus J usti-
nus. According to some, his age is supposed to be
that of the Antonines3 but the words “Imperator
Antonine‚'’ which occur in the preface of the early,
editions, are now considered an interpolation of some
one of the earlier editors. The first writer by whom
he is mentioned is Saint J erome, about A. D. 407.
How long before this time his abridgment was writ-

⁸ his use of several words which occur only in the later

writers, as adww, impossibilis, restaurare ,⁰ the indis- ’

criminate use of civitas and urbs ,· by the numerous
instances of his disregard of the regular sequence of ¹
tenses-3 and by the employment of Greek constructions
in the use of the infinitivo.
