PnoLoeus. 1. AEsopm] The
celebrated fabulist, who had the
reputation of being the originator
of sablcs. of his life and works
scarcely anything is known.
Many critics, among others Lu·
ther, have even doubted his ex-
istence. According toHerodotus,
Plutarch. and Diogenes LaertiuS,
he lived about the sixth century
B. 0., and was a cotemporary of
Solon of Athens. He was by
birth a Phrygian, served under
several masters as a slave, and re·
sided at last at the court of Croe-
sus, King of Lydia, by whom he
was sent on an embassy to Delphi,
where, accused of sacrilege, he
was thrown from a precipice and
killed, about 564 B. C. —auctor]
‘ Originally,’ ⁸ first’3 lit. ‘ the au·
thor’ or ‘ inventor.' AEsop is so
called in opposition to PhaedruS,
who placed the fablcs in a new
form.—materiam] Lit. ‘ the ma·
terial from which anything is
made? The antecedent, as is not
unusual in Latin, is put in the

relative clause. Η. 445, 9. Con-
strue: materiam, quam AEsopus
auctor repperit. — reppoeit] Writ-
ten also reperit.

2. polivi] A metaphor‚ taken
from the artist or workman (fa-
ber) who polishes the rough mate· “
rial (materiam).—senariis] ‘ With
verses of six feet.’

3. Duplex] From duo, plico, ⁸ to
fold.’ Compare the English words
‘ twofold,’ ⁴ threefold,’ etc. — dos]
In its prominent signification,
means a ‘dowry’ or ‘portion ;’ and
by duplex dos Phaedrus means the
double portion which his book,
the child of his brain, has received
forits recommendation.

4. madenti—monet] ‘ Gives wisc
counsels for the conduct of life.’

5. Calumniari] Conveys the idea
of a groundleSS, malicious criti·
cism. — voluerit] Lit. ⁸ shall have
wished.’ The English, in express·
ing the relations os time, is much
less exact than the Latin, using
often, for the future perfect, the
simple future or present.
