venerunt duo consuleS, O. Terentius et L. AEmilius.
Utriusque exercitus uno proelio fugavit3 Paulum con‘
sulem occidit, et aliquot praeterea consulares, in his Cn.
Servilium Geminum, qui superiore anno fuerat consul.

V. Hac pugna pugnata Romam profectus est, nullo ὃ

resistente. In propinquis urbi montibus moratus est.
Quum aliquot ibi dies castra habuisset, et Capuam re-

1. 0. Terentius] His cognomen
was Varro. For his incapacity,
consult Mommsen, 11. p. 154.

L. AEmilius] He was a brave
and prudent general3 but, being
forced by the rashness of Varro
to flght the battle of Cannae, he
fell, with nearly 7⁰‚000 os his
men, in the year B. C. 216. He is
called Paulus in the next line,
that having been his cognomen.

3. consulares] In the better
days of the Roman state, this
word denoted those who had been
lntrusted with the consulship.

V'. Hannibal escapes firom

Fabius by a stratagem; he de-
feats Gracchus in the year B. Ο.

5. puqnc‘z' puqnata'] This con·
struction is explained by the ac-
tive form puqnam puqnare, in
which puynam is a cognate accu-
sative. H. 371, l, 3).

Romam] He never made an
attack on Rome, and did not even

⁸ approach it till five years after the

battle of Cannae. His failure to
ronow up his victory led Mahar-
bal to say to him, Vincere scis,

Hanmbaz ‚· victoria uti nescis.

7. Capuam] This large, opu·
lent, and luxurious city revolted
to Hannibal aster the battle of
Cannae, and suffered severely in
consequence of such action. The ,
love of luxury, the rigor of the
Roman government, and the rav-
ages of the Vandals and ArabS,
caused the destruction of the an·
cient city: its ruins are situated
about three miles from the mod-
ern town.

8. Q.—Maoetmus] Fabius was
a general of eminent talenta and
virtue. He was surnamed ‘⁶ Cunc-
tator,’' or the ‘⁴ Delayer‚”. because
he successfully withstood Hanni·
bal, not by fighting him, but by
harassing him with marches and
countermarcheS.

dictator] An extraordinary
magistrate, originally called ma-
yister populi, who was invested for
six months with absolute power
in times of public danger, and
from whose decision there was no
appeal. The consuls did not re-
sign their office, bnt were subJect
to the dictator until his abdica-
tion‚ or the expiration of his term

of authority, when they resumed
their power.

9. Hic] Is here an adverb.
