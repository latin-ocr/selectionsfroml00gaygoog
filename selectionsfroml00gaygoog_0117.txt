104 LIFE OF CORmLIUS NEPOS.

distinguished friends also belonged. His moral superi-
ority is seen in his hearty admiration of noble qualities
and virtuous deeds, and in his generous appreciation
of foreign characters, especially of Rome’s greatest
enemy. But intellectually he did not rank so high:
he seems to have possessed but little of the judicial
faculty, and is sometimes obnoxious to the charge of
credulity, if not of carelessness, in the use of his
authorities. The biographies of his Greek and Bar-
barian heroes are to be viewed, therefore, as inartificial
sketches, written from a moral point of view for that
portion of the Roman public which was supposed to
be unacquainted with the Greek authors. His subjects
are, for the most part, attractive and interesting3 and
his style, notwithstanding occasional inaccuracies, Grae-
cismS, and peculiarities, is generally simple, perspicu-
ouS, and classical, and approaches more nearly than
that of Cicero and Caesar to the language of conversa-
tion and daily life. Nepos wrote also on history, geograf
phy, and morals3 but only a part of a'work, de viris
illustribus, is extant. This was divided into at least
sixteen books, one of which, de excellentibus ducibus
exterarum yentium, we possess complete3 while from
another, de Latinis historicis, only the lives of Cato
and Atticus remain. For many centurieS‚ the book
de excellentibus ducibus eoeterarum yencium, was as-
cribed to AEmilius Probus} but the comparative
purity of the style of the work, and a comparison with
>the lives .of. Cato and Atticus, known as the produc·
tions of Nepos, led Lambinus, in 1569, to dispute the
· claims of Probus3 and, this judgment having been
confirmed, Cornelius Nepos has become a familiar
name in the classical schools of the civilized world.
