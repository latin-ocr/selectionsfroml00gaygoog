2 . LIFE OF PHAEDRUS.

chus. The date of his birth, as well as ,οἳ his death,
is uncertain3 but he is known to have lived ‘in the
reigns of Augustus, TiberiuS, and Caligula, which em-
brace a period between B. O. 29 and A. D. 41. He was,
therefore, only a little later than Virgil, Horace, and
Ovid, the three great poets of the Augustan age. His
works, as they have come down to us, consist of ninety·
seven fables, distributed into five bookS, which are
written with a purity of style and clearness of expresss
sion which show him to have possessed no inferior tal-
ents as an author, and to have been a complete master
of elegant composition.

In comparing him with La Fontaine, the greatest
of the French fabulistS‚ the historian Hallam says',
“ Phaedrus, a writer scarcely prized enough, because he
is an early school-book, has a perfectiori of elegant
beauty which very few have rivalled.- N o word is out
of its place, none is redundant, or could be changed for

 

a better3 his perspicuity and ease make everything .

· appear unpremcditated, yet everything is wrought by
consummate art.” ’
