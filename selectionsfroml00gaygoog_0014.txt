REMARKS ΟΝ ΙΑΜΒΙΟ VERSE.

 

1. The verse in which the fables of Phaedrus are
written is called the Mixed Iambic Trimeter3

Iambic, from its prevailing foot, the Iambus ( υ -),
which consiste of one short and one long syllable;

Trimeter, from the fact that each verse contains
three Dipodies‚ or Pairs of feet3

Mixed‚ as distinguished from the Pure Iambic, be-
cause, while the earlier verse of this kind admitted
only the Iambu8‚ in later times Metrical Equivalents
and Metrical Substitutes took the place of the Iambus.

2. Metrical Equivalents are feet ‘having the same
quantity as the original foot. Thus dominiis, a Tri-
brach (v υ ν ), has three short syllables, which in
quantity are equivalent to those of Ρᾶνέηε, an Iam-
bus ( v - ).

Metrical Substitutes are feet used for others to which
they are not equivalent in quantity. Thus a Spondeo
(— — ), containing two long syllables, may be used
for an Iambus (v — ). ’

3. The feet employed in this verse are:

Iambus (v-), one short and one long, as . ὅυέε.
Spondee ( - - ), two long, as .’ ..... vulpes.
Tribrach (ν vv ), three short, as . . . . ᾱὸητῖηᾶε.
Dactyl (— ν v ), one long and two short, as οᾶνφηῖηᾶ.
Anapaest ( υ υ - ),two short and one long, as σᾶρῖᾶηι.

Proceleusmatic ( υ v ν ν ), four short, as . ητέηιὸνῖὅι
