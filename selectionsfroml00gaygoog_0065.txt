reign of Augustae. He himself writes that his ances«
tors had their origin from the Vocontii, a people of
Gallia Narbonensis; that his grandfather received the
right of citizenship from Pompey the Great‚ in the
Sertorian war3 that his uncle led a troop of cavalry
under the same Pompey3 a-nd that his father served

. under Julius Caesar. Trogus’s name Pompejus seems

to have been derived from his connection with the
family of Pompey.

Trogus’s history was entitled ‘⁴ Liber Historiarum
Philippicarum,” and was intended to give a complete
history of the rise, progress‚ decline, and fall of the
Macedonian monarchy. In the execution of his plan,
the author introduced the history of the Assyriam,
Medes and Persians, as well as of the several states of
Greece.' The sources of his information were doubt-
less the Greek historiam, and to Theopompus he was
indebted for the general plan of his work. It is prob-
able that the style of the history— which is greatly
admired for its purity and elegance—is chiefly that
of Trogus, though the¹ intermixture of post-Augustan
words proves that the book is not simply a collection
of extracts.
