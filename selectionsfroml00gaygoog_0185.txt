Clastidi apud Padum decernit sauciumque inde ac

fugatum dimittit.

Tertio idem Scipio cum collega,

Tiberio Longo, apud Trebiam adversus eum venit.

Cum his manum conseruit, utrosque profligavit.

5 per Ligures Apenninum transiit, petens Etruriam. Hoc

quum etiamnum premeretur, lecticaque ferretur, C. Fla-
minium consulem apud Trasimenum cum exercitu

10 insidiis circumventum occidit3 neque multo post O.

Centenium praetorem, cum delecta manu saltus occu-

pantem. Hinc in Apuliam pervenit.
