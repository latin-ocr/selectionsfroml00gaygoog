HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

BBFORE the time of Philip, the father of Alexan·
der the Great‚ Macedonia had but little influence
upon the condition of Greece. At the accession
of Philip to the throne, the kingdom was a narrow
territory around Pella, excluded partially by inde·
pendent and powerful Grecian cities even from
the neighboring sea-coast. He first manifested his
ability by changing his rude subjects into disci·
plined soldiers, and conquering the surrounding
nations. Next he availed himself of the dissen-
sions between the Grecian states, so that, at the
time of his death, Macedonian ascendency was
established from the coasts of the Propontis to
those of the Ionian Sea3 and all Greece‚ with
the exception of Sparta and some mountainous
districts, submitted to his control. It was with
soldiers trained in the twenty-four years of his
father’s reign that Alexander made the conquest

of the Persian empire. 53
