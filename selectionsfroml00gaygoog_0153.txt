CORNELIUS NEPOS.

III. Bello Peloponnesio hujus consilio atque aucto-
ritate Athenienses bellum Syracusanis indixerunt3 ad
quod gerendum ipse dux delectus est; duo praeterea
collegae dati, Nicia et Lamachus. Id quum appara-
51·etur‚. priusquam classis exiret, accidit, ut una no'cte
omnes Hermae, qui in oppido erant Athenis, dejice-
rentur praeter unum, qui ante januam erat Andocidi.
Itaque ille postea Mercurius Andocidis vocitatus est.
Hoc quum appareret non sine magna multorum con-

10 sensione esse factum, quae non ad privatam, sed pu-

blicam rem pertineret, magnus multitudini timor est

111. Alcibiades instigatae a
war against Syracuse: he is
suspected of sacrilege and trea-
son. B. Ο. 415.

- 1. Bello] This war, which was
waged between the Athenians and
Spartane, began B. C. 431, and
ended with the discomfiture of
the AthenianS, B. O. 404.

2. Syracusanis] Syracuse, once
trie largest, richest, and most pow-
ersul city of Sicily, was situated
on the eastern coast of the south-
ern portion of that island. It was
founded by the DorianS, B. C. 735.
In its most prosperous times, it
had a circumference of 180 stadia,
or over 20 English miles. Being
connected with Sparta by ties of
racc, it would naturally side with
that state, rather than with Ath-
ens,

4. dati] Sc. sunt, to be supplied
from est, at the end of the preced-
ing clause.

A Nicia] For Nicias, a Latin for
a Greek form. H. 43, 3. Nicias,
—on whom alone, in consequence
of the recall of Alcibiades and the
death of Lamachus, the conduct
of this war devolved,—though a
brave and experienced general,

was at last compelled, after great
disaster-s and sufferings‚ to surren-
der himself and his army to
the Syracusana who put him to
death, B. C. 413.

5. priusquam—exiret] The
subjunctive shows a connection
between this clause and accidit ut
dejicerem& which is merely a
periphrasis for dejecti sunt. H.
523, ΙΙ. and 2.

6. Hermoe] These were square
blocks of stone, surmounted with
a head of Hermes or Mercurius,
and were placed in the streets and
at the entranoes of house& The
Pelasgians represented Hermes
without hands and feet.

dejicerentur] Thucydides and
Plutarch say that they were mu-
tilated.

7. Andocidi] The genitive3 cf.
Pericli, ch. 11. 1. 5. Andocides

was one of the ten Attic orators. ·

Being implicated in this act of
sacrilege, he was punishcd with
atimy, a state of infamy, by which
one' lost the protection of the
lawS, and in general the rights
of a citizen.

ll. pertineret] The subjunctive
of result. H. 501.
