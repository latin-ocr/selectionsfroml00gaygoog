ΗΒΕ oF PHAEDRUS.

THE few facts we know respecting the personal his-
tory of Phaedrus, the author of the following sableS,
are gathered from his own writings. He was a native
of Thrace or of Macedonia, and at a very early age
was brought to Rome, where he became the slave of
- Augustus, whose attention 116 attracted by the integrity
of his character and his superior abilities, and from
whom he subsequently received his fieedom. In the
reign of Tiberius, he became the object of the hate
and persecution of Sejanus, the infamous confidant of
the emperor3 but in the same court 116 found friends
and protectors, and it was to these noble patrons that
116 dedicated the ingenious work in which, under the
veil of pleasing allegory, he not only covered his ene-
mies with shame and ridicule, but gave to the world
beautiful lessons of wisdom, justice, and moderatiori in
good as well as in evil fortune. By many pointed
allusions in these fables he so far incurred the wrath
of Sejanus as to be banished from the imperial court3
but under Caligula we find him in hopes of being

restored to favor by the influence of his fiiemli Euty·
