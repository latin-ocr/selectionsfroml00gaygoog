series of the Greek and Latin authors, included iu
the new programme of the studies of the Latin School,

interest on the part of the pupil, a programme has

undertaken the task of making such selections as
shall contribute to the most rapid and pleasant ad-

It has been assumed that in the books preparatory
to this series the scholar has become tolerably well
acquainted with the usual constructions and the more
common words, Theresore such notes have been
added as may enable him, by casting his eye to the
bottom of the page, to go for'ward with his reading,
