4. The Iambus is allowed in any place, but is always
found in the last.

The Proeeleusmatio is found only in the first place.

The Spondee, Tribraoh, Dactyl, and Anapaest may
stand in any place except the last.

The Iambus receives the Ictus or Rhythmio accent
on the last syllable. The Equivalents and Substitutes
take the ictus of the Iambus, and always on the first
·of the two short syllables into which a long one is
resolved.
