eisque hoc posuisset3 animadvertere debere Arcadas,
quales utraque civitas civis procreasset, ex quibus de
,ceteris possent judicare; Argivos enim fuisse Orestem
et Alcmaeonem, matricidas3 Thebis OEdipum natum,
qui quum patrem suum interfecisset, ex matre liberos 5
procreasse: hic in respondendo Epaminondas, quum
de ceteris perorasset, postqnam ad illa duo opprobria
pervenit, admirari se dixit stultitiam rhetoris Attici,
qui non animadverterit, innocentes illos natos domi,
scelere admissO, quum patria essent expulsi, receptos 10
esse ab Atheniensibus Sed maxime ejus eloquentia

2. utraque] Duo, ‘two,' in op-
position to any other number, is

caste. Having been exposed un
Mount Cithaeron, he was found
by a Corinthian shepherd, and
reared by the king of Corinth.
Having reached the age ot* man-

he resolved to visit ThebeS. On
his way thither, he met Laius on
the road between Delphi and
Daulis. In a scuffle provoked by
the charioteer of the king, Laius
was slain by his son, who knew
neither the rank of the king, nor
his relationship to him. After-
wardS, having destroyed the
Sphinx, a monster which was
molesting the ThebanS, he mar-
ried his mother, Iocaste. Some
years thel-eaftcr, he discovered
his origin, and the crimes he
had ignorantly committed. Filled
with grief and remorse, he ban·
ished himself from ThebeS, and
retired to Attica, where he died
in a grove sacred to the Furies,
near Colonus.
