2. verba dedit]

⁸ Deceived3 ’

mayistrum equitum] No dic· -

literally‚ ‘ gave wordS‚' as opposed tator could be without a inaqister

to decdS.

3. obducta· nocte] Sc. coelo,
⁴ when night had come on.’

7. vallum] Sc. castrorum. The
term properly means the palisade

- which ran along the outer edge

of the rampart; but very sre-
quently it includes the rampart
also. The vallum, in the latter
sense, with the ditch (fossa)
which surrounded the camp out-
side of the vallum, formed a com-
plete fortification.

sit ausus] Fabius had posted
4000 men to guard the pass, while
the main body lay encamped on a
neighboring hill. Hannibal, by
his stratagem, frightened away
the guardS, and so extricated his
army.

8. Minucium] This officer was
associated with Fabius in the
command of the Roman army,
when the cautious movements of
that general led the people to dis-
trust his courage. MinuciuS, how·
ever, recognizing the wisdom and
abilities of Fabius, resigned his
authority as ‹zo-dictator.

equitum, whom he was generally
permitted to nominate himself.
The maqister equitum was subject
to the command of the dictator;
but in the absence of his supe·
rior, he became his representative
and exercised his power. This
investment of Minucius with dic-
tatorial power, by which two dic-
tators were virtually created, is
expressly mentioned as an anom-
aly which had never occurred be-
fore.

9. ac dictatorem] The accusa-
tive by attraction-

10. Gracchum] Ti. Sempronius
Gracchus was a brave and active
general, and distinguished for his
high character and abilities.

iterum] Should be his, as he
was not consul the year of his
death3 iterum implies that he
was.

. 11. in Lucrinis] Belongs to sus-
tulit, which is here equivaleut to
occidit.. Hannibal did this though
absent, inasmuch as it was done
by MagO‚ sui-named the Samnite⁴
oue of his lieutenants.
